               <h2>Overview</h2>
               <p>We are honored to have been able to help The Woodmark Group help achieve its goal of cultivating the best fundraising practices among its members. The Woodmark Group sought the iSchool because of an information problem. Their resource sharing platform before the project was failing in many areas including ease of use, consistent engagement, searchability, and overall managability from the staff's perspective.</p>
					<h1>Current State Analysis</h1>
               <p>The project started by analyzing the current state of the Woodmark Exchange (WE) and enumerating specific pitfalls in the design and experience from a staff and user perspective. These issues were rated in terms of priority and formed the criteria for choosing a solution. The top five issues as identified from these preliminary meetings are below.</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>Sub-optimal searchability</li>
                  <li>Calendar Integration</li>
                  <li>Master library/Library Management</li>
                  <li>Inconsistent web traffic/Unreliable notification system</li>
                  <li>Exporting Contacts/Profile Customization</li>
               </ol>
               <br /><br /><h1>Platform Research and Comparison</h1>
               <p>It became clear that the current platform could not be scaled to meet the challenges Woodmark faced. We researched solutions to the above five pain points on other platforms. Some of the options considered were Confluence, Slack, Mobilize, Unily, as well as a platform called Higher Logic that had been considered by the Woodmark Staff before. Higher Logic met every one of our priortized needs and at the end of 2017 the Executive Director of The Woodmark Group signed a contract with Higher Logic for four years.</p>
               <br /><br /><h1>Design and Implementation</h1>
               <p>We implemented a preliminary design as well as several features such as custom profile fields specific to Woodmark members, and member search optimized for shop rolls.</p>
